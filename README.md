# List To Table

> List To Table is a web application that was built with the mobile-first approach by a team of 6 individuals in the course of 6 weeks. It has 2 interfaces: a guest and a restaurant side. The guest interface allows the user to view how busy restaurants are and check-in to the waitlist remotely in a certain mile radius. The restaurant interface allows restaurants to view and manage their waitlist at real-time with 3 easy functions: 'notify', 'seat', and 'delete'. If the guest is at the top of the list, the restaurant can 'notify' the customer through text messages. In addition, if the guest has checked in with the restaurant, the restuarant can click 'seat' to update their list. 

> This project could not have been completed without the help of our mentor, Andy Ong. We greatly appreciate the hard-work and his dedication to our team.
